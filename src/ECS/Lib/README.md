# Whaley's Entity Component System
This code is heavily based on this writeup: https://austinmorlan.com/posts/entity_component_system/

The main changes are:

1. Does not rely on RTTI to make unique IDs for components/systems. Uses compile-time type IDs instead
2. Single header (plus some cpp files) for an improved API
3. Systems now have virtual onAdd and onDelete functions, which makes it easier to interact with non-ECS systems that interact w/ components. Logic for non-trivial component destructors should go in the onDelete function of a single-component system.

## Constraints

1. Components need a default constructor and be copyable (you can still use other constructors for initialization)
2. Components need a unique type (after name mangling -> aliases aren't unique)
3. Systems need a default constructor
4. Cannot store pointers to components. Components are densely packed in arrays, so a deleted entity may make the pointer invalid

## TODO

### Need:

- safer way to call entity.set(), because it currently circumvents the onRemove pattern I have, causing memory leaks for things with VAOs/VBOs/other manually deallocated stuff
- thread-safe system methods
- auto-call systems
    - system scheduler (every X frames / ongamestart / ongameend) + chaining (run sys1, then sys2; sys3 no dependencies so can thread)

# Nice to have

- Entity should have some compile() method which sets it Alive in the EntityManager and sends a patternChanged signal -> patternChanged signal (not sent for dead entities), which will prevent a bunch of patternChanged calls from happening while an entity is initialized
- max entities/max components values should be macros which are optionally defined before the first time ECS.h is included, similar to rapidXML

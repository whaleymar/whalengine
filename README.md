# unnamed engine
A WIP 2D game engine written in C++ with OpenGL and GLFW, backed by a simple Entity Component System

# To Do 
## Systems
- animation

- lighting
- textures (part of drawing)
    - stitch textures into atlas at startup (or with script)

## Components

- Light 
- lifetime

## Entity Prefabs
- particle
- solid tile

## Errors
- image lib has exceptions

## Non-ECS Systems
- Scenes
- loading entity from file

## Misc
- only store xy coord in vertices
- square vertices with 4 vertices not 6
- ECS lib todos

# unnamed engine
A WIP 2D game engine written in C++ with OpenGL and GLFW, backed by a simple Entity Component System

# To Do 
## Systems
- drawing
- animation
- delta time 
- sound
- lighting
- textures
    - stitch textures into atlas at startup (or with script)
- physics

## Components
- Follow
- Light 
- actor collider
- solid collider
- player controlled
- lifetime

## Entity Prefabs
- particle

## Errors
- image lib has exceptions

## Non-ECS Systems
- delta time 
- Scenes
- loading from file

## Misc
- only store xy coord in vertices
- square vertices with 4 vertices not 6
